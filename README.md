# CME241 Assignment Repo

Repo for managing my assignment solution as well as self-learning materials for [CME 241](http://web.stanford.edu/class
/cme241/), taught by Prof. Ashwin Rao at Stanford University.

## Assignment

My solution for assignments are listed and linked [here](./assignment/README.md)


## Useful Resources:

### Github repo:

### Misc:
Here I listed some RL-related talks and recent papers I found interesting (*TBD*): 
- [Optimization Perspectives on Learning to Control](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/l2c-icml2018/)
    
    This is a tutorial given by Prof. Ben Recht at ICML 2018 in which he discussed the intersection of optimal
     control adn RL.
