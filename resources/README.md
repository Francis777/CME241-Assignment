### Misc:

Here I listed some RL-related talks and recent papers I found interesting (_TBD_):

- [Optimization Perspectives on Learning to Control](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/l2c-icml2018/)
  This is a tutorial given by Prof. Ben Recht at ICML 2018 in which he discussed the intersection of optimal
  control and RL.
  
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00444)

  This is a recently published (Feb 2020) summary of deep RL algorithms which provides a taxonomy of automated
  driving tasks where deep RL methods have been used. Highlights key challenges for real world deployment and role
  of simulators.
